🔍 Observations
While loading → UI appears broken / empty
On error → user sees nothing
On empty → no feedback or CTA
No retry mechanism anywhere
🧠 Loading Strategy
Lists (Orders, Products, Customers) → Skeleton cards
Dashboard stats → Skeleton boxes
👉 Reason: Layout stability + better perceived performance

⚠️ Error State Copy
Orders: "We couldn't load your orders. Try again."
Products: "Inventory failed to load. Retry."
